#a backend for a kid's visit scheduling platform

The system implements an API to allow reciprocal, on-going childcare arrangements.
Scheduled visits are created from contracts betwween parents and sitters.
Sitters and parents argee to certain terms as part of a visit contract.
The platform facilitates the process of creating and executing visit contracts.

 There are a few basic concepts:
 * Parent
 * Child
 * Family
 * Family Network
 * Sitter
 * Sitter Home
 * Visit
 
 There are also a few basic processes
 * Parent, Child, Sitter, Family, Family Network creation
 * " " " deletion
 * " " " update

 * Provisional Visit Contract Creation 
 * Communication Channel creation, posting, editing, and deleting
 * Visit Contract Execution

 For a parent, here's how it works:
 * You are given a reference link from someone you know, allowing you to join the platform
 * You sign up yourself and your kids, either through an app or a web ui
 * You give a fair amount of detail about yourself and your kids, most of which is kept private.
 * You write a few short descriptives sentences about yourself and your kids and a profile is generated.
 * You are awarded a few credits and you can browse nearby sitters' profiles.
 * You also have the option to make connections and/or join a network, allowing you to open communication channels with individuals or join public channels with others in your network.
 * You can initiate a visit with a sitter, or join an open visit, effectively opening a channel between you and the sitter and instantiating a contract.
 * You negotiate the contract through the platform and then both jointly book the visit (sign the contract).
 * The visit occurs according to the negotiated terms.
 * You leave a private review, visible only to the platform, after the pick-up. 
 * The next time you want to schedule a visit, you log back on.

 For a sitter, here's how it works:
 * You are either a family with kids and a parent at home, or you are an older person who likes supervising children ("the other family" or "Grandma Judy")
 * You are given a reference link from someone you know, allowing you to join the platform
 * You create an account for you and any family members living with you.
 * You include an address and background check is done automatically on you and any others living in your house
 * You include photos and a wide variety of other information, including a bit of writing and lots of fact questions. Some information is kept private and not included on your profile.
 * You sign up for an in-home visit from a platform rep, who is just another platform member with a high reputation who earns credits by visiting new sitter homes.
 * You receive credits for a successful in-home visit.
 * After your in-home visit, you can create open visits or accept visit proposals from parents.
 * You manage a calendar of availability, which you are incentivized to keep up-to-date.
 * Completing kid visits earns you credits and increases your reputation, which raises the number of incoming visit requests you get.
